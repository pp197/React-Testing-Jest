##  Library and purpose 

@testing-library/react      -> Uses reactDom to render a component for testing
@testing-library/user-event -> Helps simulate user even like typing and clicking
@testing-library/dom        -> Helps find elements that are rendered by our component
jest                        -> Runs our tests and report results 
jsdom                       -> simulates a browser when running in a Node environment 


## Behind the scenes : How were are tests found ?

Jest finds all the files in the src folder that 
    - End with .spec.js
    - End with .test.js 
    - Are placed in a folder called __test__ (two underscored each side)


## What did all the testing code do (example.test.js)?

In our example.test.js file we have defined two tests 
- we define a test calling a built in 'test' function, followed by a function that contains our actual testing code.
- render our component
- use screen to find our element by heading 
- receive array of elements and make sure we have 6 of then by default
